There are eras of human history in which the channels of thought have been too deeply cut and no change was possible, and nothing new ever happened, and “best” was a matter of dogma, but that is not the situation now. Now the stream of our common consciousness seems to be obliterating its own banks, losing its central direction and purpose, flooding the lowlands, disconnecting and isolating the highlands and to no particular purpose other than the wasteful fulfillment of its own internal momentum. Some channel deepening seems called for.

A prime number is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1. 17 and 23 are prime because they can’t be written as two smaller numbers multiplied together, whereas 15 isn’t prime because 15=3×5. Prime numbers are the most important numbers in mathematics because all other whole numbers are built by multiplying primes together.

Fermat showed that the test can be extended past powers of 2 by proving that if p is prime, then for any number n less than p, np always has remainder n when divided by the prime p. So if you find any number n for which this fails, you can throw out p as a prime impostor.

While going deeply into detail on the explain command would (and does!) fill an entire book, the first piece of information you should be looking for is in the cursor field. MongoDB uses either a BasicCursor or BtreeCursor when scanning collections of documents; for a heavily-used query, you want to avoid using a BasicCursor because it scans through every document in the collection to find a result.

MongoDB includes a function called findAndModify, which handles searching and updating in a single function. This adds an extra layer of security because it ensures the update happens immediately when a record is found, rather than adding round-trip time to process the record on the client side and save it back to the database, during which time someone else might change the record and cause the concurrent access problem described earlier.

One thing that happens when you start to really play with Node.js is you think of JavaScript in terms of I/O interactions. The initialize function is a shining example of the callback flow; it’s easy to try to read the file as a whole and get lost in layers of callbacks and functions, but when we write our code like in Example 6-3 , it makes the programmer’s intent clear.

By the time the request comes through to your callback method, it contains more than just the web browser’s message — it contains everything the server knows about that message. Express’s session middleware is part of the server’s understanding of the request; the web browser sends an identifier, which the server uses to read the user’s session data from the memory store (described later in this chapter). The nice part about this is it’s done under the covers so you can just access the results of that read through the session variable attached to the request object.

Using limit causes Express to cut off incoming requests after a certain amount of data — in this case, one megabyte. This will help protect our application from distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, which would arise if sessions were allowed to post large requests that would otherwise bog down Express attempting to parse.

When the view is initialized, call the bind() function on the model (in this case, we will be expecting an account model). The first parameter, change, means the action is to occur whenever any changes occur to the class model. The second parameter, this.render, refers to the function that will be executed every time the model changes.
